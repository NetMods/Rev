# Rev, Next-gen screen recorder

Todos:
- wire up a simple dock UI, just the start and stop button
- setup backend to get a simple recorded video
- get the mouse clicks (with coordinates) and keyboard presses during recording with their timestamps
- get the video directly on the canvas
- make zoom in and out effect on the user activity
- capture the output of canvas, and we will have zoom effects in realtime

And we are done with the basic functionality
