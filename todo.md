## 1. **Error Handling & Recovery**
**Critical Issues:**
- No global error boundaries or crash recovery mechanisms
- Silent failures in video/audio processing
- Missing timeout handling for FFmpeg operations
- No fallback mechanisms when devices fail

**Priority:** HIGH - This is likely causing most of your reliability issues

## 2. **Resource Management & Memory Leaks**
**Critical Issues:**
- Video elements not properly cleaned up in `VideoManager`
- Canvas contexts and event listeners not consistently destroyed
- FFmpeg processes potentially orphaned on crashes
- File handles and temporary directories not always cleaned up

**Priority:** HIGH

## 3. **State Management Architecture**
**Problems:**
- Mixed state management (Jotai atoms + local useState)
- Complex interdependent state updates in recording/annotation modules
- Race conditions between UI state and backend processes
- No centralized state for application lifecycle

**Priority:** HIGH

## 4. **Process Communication & Synchronization**
**Issues:**
- IPC handlers lack proper error propagation
- No request/response correlation for async operations
- Mouse tracking and video recording not properly synchronized
- Export process lacks proper progress feedback and cancellation

**Priority:** HIGH

## 5. **Module Architecture & Dependencies**
**Problems:**
- Tight coupling between modules (annotation, recording, export)
- Circular dependencies in some areas
- No clear separation of concerns
- Module initialization order dependencies

**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH

## 6. **File System & Temporary Data Management**
**Issues:**
- Inconsistent temporary file cleanup
- No atomic file operations
- Race conditions in project data updates
- Missing file system error handling

**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH

## 7. **Platform-Specific Code**
**Issues:**
- Platform detection scattered throughout codebase
- Inconsistent handling of platform differences (paths, devices, etc.)
- FFmpeg argument construction needs centralization

**Priority:** MEDIUM

## 8. **Performance & Optimization**
**Issues:**
- Canvas rendering not optimized for different screen densities
- Video processing lacks proper frame rate management
- Memory usage grows during long recordings
- No request debouncing/throttling

**Priority:** MEDIUM

## Recommended Refactoring Order:

1. **Start with Error Handling** - Add global error boundaries and proper error propagation
2. **Fix Resource Management** - Implement proper cleanup patterns
3. **Centralize State Management** - Move to a single state management solution
4. **Improve IPC Architecture** - Add proper request/response patterns
5. **Modularize Platform Code** - Create platform abstraction layer
6. **Optimize Performance** - Address memory leaks and rendering issues

Would you like me to dive deeper into any of these areas and provide specific refactoring strategies?
